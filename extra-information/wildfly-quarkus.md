WildFly and Quarkus are both popular Java-based application servers used for developing and deploying web applications. However, there are some differences between them.

WildFly is a robust and flexible open-source application server that was originally created by JBoss. It is known for its support for the latest Java EE standards and APIs, as well as its modular architecture that allows developers to choose the specific services they need for their application. WildFly is often used for enterprise applications that require scalability, high availability, and advanced security features.

On the other hand, Quarkus is a modern, cloud-native framework designed for building lightweight and fast applications. It is built using the GraalVM and is optimized for running in containerized environments. Quarkus is known for its fast startup times, low memory usage, and high-performance capabilities, which makes it ideal for building microservices and serverless applications.

In terms of architecture, WildFly uses a traditional, monolithic architecture that is designed for running large, complex applications. Quarkus, on the other hand, uses a microservices architecture that is designed for building small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently.

Both WildFly and Quarkus are popular choices for developing and deploying Java-based web applications, and the choice between the two often depends on the specific needs of the application and the development team's preferences and expertise.
