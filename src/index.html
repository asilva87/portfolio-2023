  <!-- The <base> tag specifies the base URL/target for all relative URLs in a web page. In the case of
    an Angular app, it's used to specify the base URL for the router to resolve the relative paths for
    the different routes that are defined in the application. The value of the href attribute is the base
    URL that the router will use when navigating to different views within the app. In this case, the base
    URL is set to the root directory of the web server. -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <!-- This line sets the viewport metadata for the web page. The viewport refers to the visible area
    of a web page in a web browser. The content attribute specifies the properties of the viewport, in
    this case, the width of the viewport is set to the device's width and the initial-scale is set to 1,
    which means that the width of the viewport will be equal to the width of the device and the initial
    zoom level of the page will be 100%. This is an important meta tag in making the web page responsive
    and mobile-friendly. -->
  <!-- This line sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device and sets the initial zoom level
    to 1. This is important for ensuring that the website or application displays properly and responsively
    on different devices, with different screen sizes and resolutions. Without setting the viewport, the
    website or application might not be displayed properly on certain devices, leading to a poor user
    experience. It could also lead to inconsistent or unexpected layout and formatting, making it difficult
    for users to navigate and use the website or application. -->
