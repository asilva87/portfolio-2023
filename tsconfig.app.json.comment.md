The "tsconfig.app.json" file is part of an Angular project and is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options specific to the application. It extends the base TypeScript configuration file "tsconfig.json", which is used for the entire project, but only includes the settings that are specific to the application.

By default, the "tsconfig.app.json" file includes settings that are optimized for an Angular application, such as enabling experimental decorators and strict null checks. It also specifies the paths to the application's source code and any external libraries that the application depends on.

The "tsconfig.app.json" file can be customized to fit the specific needs of an application, such as enabling or disabling certain compiler options, changing the paths to source files, or including/excluding specific files from the compilation process.
