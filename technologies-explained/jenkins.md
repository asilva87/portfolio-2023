Jenkins can be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process for Angular applications. Here's an example workflow:

  1. Pull the Angular application code from a source code repository like GitHub or Bitbucket.
  2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
  3. Build the application using `ng build`.
  4. Run unit and integration tests using `ng test`.
  5. Build a production-ready version of the application using `ng build --prod`.
  6. Deploy the application to a staging or production environment using a deployment script.

Jenkins can be configured to perform each of these steps automatically whenever changes are made to the codebase. This helps to ensure that the application is always built, tested, and deployed in a consistent and reliable manner.
