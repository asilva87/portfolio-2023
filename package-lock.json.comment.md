The "package-lock.json" file is used by NPM (Node Package Manager) to lock down the specific versions of each package and its dependencies that are used in a project. It ensures that everyone working on the project is using the exact same package versions, and prevents unexpected changes from being made to the project's dependencies.

When you install a package or update an existing one, NPM will update the "package-lock.json" file to reflect the exact versions that were installed. When someone else on your team clones the project and runs npm install, NPM will use the "package-lock.json" file to install the exact same versions of the packages and dependencies.

The "package-lock.json" file is automatically generated by NPM and should be committed to version control along with the "package.json" file. This ensures that everyone working on the project is using the same dependencies and versions.

The purpose of "package-lock.json" is to keep track of the exact version of every installed package in the application's node_modules directory, along with their dependencies.

While "package.json" defines the dependencies for an application, it <b>doesn't track the exact versions that are installed</b>. This means that if another developer or a build system installs the same dependencies but with different versions, the application might behave differently or even break.

To prevent these issues, "package-lock.json" was introduced in npm version 5 to provide a way to lock down the versions of packages installed by npm. This file ensures that the exact same versions of packages are installed for everyone working on the project, regardless of the environment they are working on.
